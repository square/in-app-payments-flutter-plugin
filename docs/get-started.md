# Getting Started with the Flutter Plugin for In-App Payments SDK

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a new Flutter
project with In-App Payments SDK. See the
[Flutter In-App Payments SDK Technical Reference](reference.md)
for more detailed information about the methods available.


## Before you start

* You will need a Square account enabled for payment processing. If you have not
  enabled payment processing on your account (or you are not sure), visit
  [squareup.com/activate].
* Follow the **Install** instructions in the [Flutter Getting Started] guide to
  set up your Flutter development environment.


## Process overview

* [Step 1: Create a Flutter project](#step-1-create-a-flutter-project)
* [Step 2: Configure the In-App Payments SDK dependency](#step-2-configure-the-in-app-payments-sdk-dependency)
* [Step 3: Get Square Application ID](#step-3-get-square-application-id)
* [Step 4: Initialize the In-App Payments SDK](#step-4-initialize-the-in-app-payments-sdk)
* [Step 5: Implement the Payment flow](#step-5-implement-the-payment-flow)

## Step 1: Create a Flutter project

The basic command is:

```bash
flutter create in_app_payments_flutter_app
```

See the **Create the app** step of the [Test Drive] section in Flutter's getting
started guide for more detailed instructions.


## Step 2: Configure the In-App Payments SDK dependency

Edit the `pubspec.yaml` file in your `flutter` directory to define the In-App Payments
SDK dependency:
```yaml
dependencies:

  ...

  square_in_app_payments:
    git: https://github.com/square/in-app-payments-flutter-plugin.git
```

## Step 3: Get Square Application ID

1. Open the [Square Application Dashboard].
1. Create a new Square application.
1. Click on the new application to bring up the Square application settings
   pages.
1. You will need the **Application ID** from the
   **Credentials** page to configure In-App Payments SDK in the next steps.

## Step 4: Initialize the In-App Payments SDK

1. Add code that initialize the In-App Payments SDK.
   ```dart
   import 'package:square_in_app_payments/models.dart';
   import 'package:square_in_app_payments/in_app_payments.dart';

   class _MyAppState {
     ...
     Future<void> _initSquarePayment() async {
       await InAppPayments.setSquareApplicationId('APPLICATION_ID');
     }
     ...
   } 

   ```

1. Replace `APPLICATION_ID` with the **application ID** from the application dashboard.

## Step 5: Implement the Payment flow

Add code to the `_MyAppState_` class that starts the payment flow and handles
the response. 

**Note**: You cannot start the payment flow from a modal screen. To start
the payment flow, you must close the modal screen before calling `startCardEntryFlow`.

```dart
import 'package:square_in_app_payments/models.dart';
import 'package:square_in_app_payments/in_app_payments.dart';
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
...
  /** 
  * An event listner to start card entry flow
  */
  Future<void> _onStartCardEntryFlow() async {
    await InAppPayments.startCardEntryFlow(
        onCardNonceRequestSuccess: _onCardEntryCardNonceRequestSuccess,
        onCardEntryCancel: _onCancelCardEntryFlow);
  }

  /**
  * Callback when card entry is cancelled and UI is closed
  */
  void _onCancelCardEntryFlow() {
    // Handle the cancel callback
  }

  /**
  * Callback when successfully get the card nonce details for processig
  * card entry is still open and waiting for processing card nonce details
  */
  void _onCardEntryCardNonceRequestSuccess(CardDetails result) async {
    try {
      // take payment with the card nonce details
      // you can take a charge
      // await chargeCard(result);

      // payment finished successfully
      // you must call this method to close card entry
      InAppPayments.completeCardEntry(
          onCardEntryComplete: _onCardEntryComplete);
    } on Exception catch (ex) {
      // payment failed to complete due to error
      // notify card entry to show processing error
      InAppPayments.showCardNonceProcessingError(ex.message);
    }
  }

  /**
  * Callback when the card entry is closed after call 'completeCardEntry'
  */
  void _onCardEntryComplete() {
    // Update UI to notify user that the payment flow is finished successfully
  }
  ...
}  
```
---
**Note:** the `chargeCard` method in this example shows a typical REST request on a backend process that uses the **Transactions API** to take a payment with the supplied nonce. See [BackendQuickStart Sample] to learn about building an app that processes payment nonces on a server.
