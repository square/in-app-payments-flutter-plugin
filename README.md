## In-App Payments SDK requirements and limitations

* In-App Payments SDK cannot issue refunds. Refunds can be issued programmatically using
  the Refunds API or manually in the [Square Dashboard].

## Sample applications
* **[Quick start flutter app]:** You can learn how the In-App-Payments Flutter plugin is used by [getting started with the example app], a quick-start Flutter app that lets you take a payment after completing 6 set up steps. 
* **Quick start backend app:** The [In-App Payments Server Quickstart](https://github.com/square/in-app-payments-server-quickstart) 
takes the nonce created by the flutter app and uses it to create a payment credited to your Square account. Use this backend sample to quickly create a complete payment flow.
